Time complexity
---------------

O(f(n)) = n! 

O(f(n)) = 2^n # exponential // happens in calculating fibanocci with recuirsion!

O(f(n)) = n^2 # quadratic

O(f(n)) = n*log(n)

O(f(n)) = n # linear

O(f(n)) = log(n)

O(f(n)) = 1 # constant

Big O of some of the common data structures.

# Arrays are ordered means every poistion is fixed
# Objects are unordered

# Arrays

Insertion - at the end O(1) , at the beginning O(n) because we have to re-index every element 
Deletion - at the end O(1) , at the beginning O(n) because we have to re-index every element
Searching - O(n)
Access - O(1)
